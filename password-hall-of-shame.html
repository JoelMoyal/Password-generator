        <h1 class="article-title">Password Hall of Shame: Real Weak Passwords in Real Systems</h1>

        <p class="article-intro">This isn't about mocking ordinary people who reused a password. It's about systems, organizations, and administrators who had the resources and responsibility to do better — and didn't. Four cases where catastrophically weak credentials got past everyone who should have caught them, and what each one teaches.</p>

        <div class="case-card">
            <div class="case-header">
                <span class="case-number">Case 1</span>

            </div>

            <div class="case-section">
                <div class="case-label">The credential</div>
                <div class="case-password">123456</div>
            </div>

            <div class="case-section">
                <div class="case-label">What happened</div>
                <p>Researchers discovered that the backend of a McDonald's AI-powered hiring chatbot was accessible using an admin login with the password <strong>123456</strong>. The backend exposed access to a large amount of job applicant data, including personal information submitted by people who thought they were applying for a job.</p>

            <div class="case-section">
                <div class="case-label">Why it's instructive</div>
                <p>123456 has topped every "most common passwords" list for over a decade. It's the first thing any attacker tries. And yet it was protecting a production system handling real applicant data for one of the largest employers in the world. The most famous weak password in the world still works — because default credentials get deployed and never changed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-lesson">
                <strong>What it teaches:</strong> Default credentials must be changed before any system goes live. No exceptions. Enforce minimum password complexity at the system level, not via policy alone. And wherever possible, add MFA so that a guessed password alone isn't sufficient.

            <div class="case-section">
                <div class="case-label">What happened</div>
                <p>In the 2021 Oldsmar incident, someone remotely accessed a Florida water treatment plant's control systems and briefly changed chemical levels to dangerous concentrations. Investigations revealed the facility was using remote access software with a password shared among multiple employees, on a network with limited segmentation. An operator caught the change in time and reversed it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-section">
                <div class="case-label">Why it's instructive</div>
                <p>A shared password means no accountability and no revocation. When a shared credential is compromised — whether by a former employee, a breach on another system, or direct attack — you can't rotate it quietly. Everyone using it has to be notified, and any of them could have been the leak. In critical infrastructure, "shared password" is a class of failure, not just a weak password.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-lesson">
                <strong>What it teaches:</strong> Every person who needs access gets their own account. Shared logins make audit trails meaningless and revocation painful. MFA on remote access to any sensitive system is non-negotiable. Segmented network access limits the blast radius when any account is compromised.

            </div>

                <div class="case-label">The credential</div>
                <div class="case-password">in a hidden tab</div>
            </div>

            <div class="case-section">
                <div class="case-label">What happened</div>
                <p>Colorado's Secretary of State office accidentally published a spreadsheet to a public website that contained hidden tabs with still-active passwords for some of the state's voting systems. The spreadsheet was intended for public release, but the hidden tabs were not scrubbed before publication. The passwords were discovered by a member of the public who knew to look for hidden sheets.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-section">
                <div class="case-label">Why it's instructive</div>
                <p>"Hidden tab" is not access control. Spreadsheets are deceptively porous — hidden columns, hidden sheets, and embedded metadata all survive exports that look clean on the surface. This is particularly acute because spreadsheets are often used as informal credential stores in organizations that haven't moved to proper secrets management. The file looked fine. It wasn't.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-lesson">
                <strong>What it teaches:</strong> Treat spreadsheets and documents like code: review them before publishing. Strip hidden sheets, hidden columns, and embedded metadata. Never store active credentials in a document that could be shared. If a document was a credential store at any point in its history, assume those credentials are compromised before any external release.

                <span class="case-title">The Password That Passes Every Complexity Check and Cracks in Seconds</span>
            </div>

            <div class="case-section">
                <div class="case-label">The credential</div>
                <div class="case-password">P@ssw0rd1!</div>

            <div class="case-section">
                <div class="case-label">What happened</div>
                <p>Breach data consistently shows that when organizations enforce complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, number, symbol), users respond by applying predictable transformations to simple words: <strong>Password</strong> becomes <strong>P@ssw0rd</strong>, then <strong>P@ssw0rd1</strong>, then <strong>P@ssw0rd1!</strong>. The password passes every filter. It cracks in seconds because every cracking tool includes these exact transformations in its ruleset.</p>
                <p>This isn't a single incident — it's a pattern observed across hundreds of millions of cracked credentials. It's what happens when complexity rules meet human psychology at scale.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-section">
                <div class="case-label">Why it's instructive</div>
                <p>Complexity requirements were designed to force randomness. Instead, they forced legibility — short, memorable words with just enough symbols appended to satisfy a filter. The password looks strong. The strength meter might even turn green. But attackers precompute these transformations. A word with substitutions is barely harder to crack than the original word.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-lesson">
                <strong>What it teaches:</strong> NIST now explicitly recommends against mandatory complexity rules for exactly this reason. Length beats complexity every time. Block known-weak passwords at the system level using a blocklist. Encourage passphrases and random generation. A 20-character random password that looks "simple" is infinitely stronger than <strong>P@ssw0rd1!</strong>.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>The pattern across all four cases</h2>

        <p>These incidents look different on the surface but share a structure. In every case, someone had a responsibility to enforce better credential hygiene and didn't. The tools existed. The guidance existed. The failure was organizational: unchecked defaults, shared accounts, unsanitized documents, and rules designed to satisfy a checkbox rather than produce real security.</p>

        <p>The embarrassing thing isn't that the passwords were weak. It's that no layer of defense caught them before they mattered.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enforce, don't recommend.</strong> Policy alone doesn't change behavior. Blocklists, MFA enforcement, and minimum lengths built into systems work. Memos don't.</li>
            <li><strong>Unique accounts for every person.</strong> Shared credentials have no audit trail and no clean revocation path.</li>
            <li><strong>Treat every document as potentially public.</strong> Sanitize before sharing. Rotate anything that was ever in a document that left your control.</li>
            <li><strong>Complexity rules without blocklists produce theater.</strong> Block <code>P@ssw0rd</code> explicitly. Encourage length and randomness instead.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout green">
            <p><strong>The fix is the same every time:</strong> unique accounts, strong random passwords or passphrases, MFA on anything sensitive, and no shared credentials. It's not complicated. It just has to actually happen.</p>
